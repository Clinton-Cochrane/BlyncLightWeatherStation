# Blync Light Weather Station
This project is for seeing the current weather conditions in Bartlesville, Ok. I made a UI to show useful information at a glance like, weather conditions, temp, percipitation amount, humidity, and sun schedule. I also hooked it up to a Blync light and at a quicker glance I can see the weather based on the colour of the light. It uses an altered version of the blync class library and openweathermap's api. 


## Getting Started
You will need to request an api key from OpenWeatherMap and insert it into the app.config.
